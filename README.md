# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This repository contains the implementations and solutions for three assignments as part of the COMP 352 course.

**Language:** Java  
**Type:** Individual Assignments

## Main Takeaway:

- Understanding stack-based algorithms and their applications.
- Implementing and analyzing time complexity for different algorithms.
- Working with priority queues and heaps for managing priority data.
- Designing efficient and flexible ADTs (Abstract Data Types).

## Assignment 1: Oddonacci Numbers

**Description:**  
The Oddonacci numbers are defined similarly to Fibonacci numbers, but each value afterward is the sum of the preceding three values. Your task is to implement both versions (linear and exponential time complexity) and measure their performance for different values of Oddonacci.

**Key Features:**

- Implement two versions of the Oddonacci calculation: one slow (exponential) and one fast (linear).
- Test and compare how long each version takes for different input sizes.
- Explain the differences in speed between the two versions.

## Assignment 2: Arithmetic Calculator Using Stacks

**Description:**  
You are tasked with implementing an arithmetic calculator using stack-based operations to evaluate mathematical expressions. The calculator reads expressions from a file, computes their values, and writes the results to an output file.

**Key Features:**

- Build your own stack structure using expandable arrays.
- Evaluate mathematical expressions that include parentheses and operators and comparison operators.
- Read expressions from a file, compute the result, and write the output to a new file.
- Explain how fast your program is (time complexity) and how much space it uses (space complexity).
- Provide test cases with complex math expressions.

## Assignment 3: The Smarter PQ (Priority Queue)

**Description:**  
You are tasked with implementing a flexible priority queue (SPQ) ADT using an extendable array-based heap structure. The SPQ allows for switching between min- and max-priority queues, and your implementation must not duplicate code for min- and max-heap operations.

**Key Features:**

- Create a priority queue that can switch between min-heap and max-heap modes.
- Reuse the same code for both min-heap and max-heap without duplicating your work.
- Implement methods to insert, remove, and change the priority of items in the queue.
- Explain how fast different operations are, such as inserting or removing items.
- Provide test cases showing how your queue handles different scenarios.
